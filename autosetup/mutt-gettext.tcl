# @synopsis:
#
# The 'gettext' module implements a subset of the functionality provided by the
# AM_GNU_GETTEXT macro. Namely, it supports the 'external' configuration where
# a libintl library is supposed to be present in the system, in contrast to it
# being built as part of the package.

# Try to locate a usable gettext installation in the system.
#
# If found, returns 1 and sets 'ENABLE_NLS' to 1. Otherwise, returns 0.
